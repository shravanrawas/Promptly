# Promptly

this application allows users to interact with an AI model to generate responses, manage their chat history, and perform additional actions like saving, deleting, and searching through past chats.

Demo: https://promptly-mu.vercel.app/

## Features

  - User Authentication: Secure user authentication using Clerk.
  - View recent chats in a sidebar.
  - Save user chat history to MockAPI.
  - Search through saved chats.
  - Delete individual chats.
  - Responsive UI: Built with Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS and ShadCN.
 
## Technologies Used

  - Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN
  - AI Integration: Gemini AI model
  - State Management: Redux Toolkit
  - API Handling: Axios
  - Authentication: Clerk
  - Mock Backend: MockAPI

## Challenges Faced: 

  -  I faced difficulties in configuring the Gemini AI model with the frontend application due to unfamiliarity with its API and the specific configurations required, such as generation parameters (e.g., temperature, topP, and max tokens). Debugging API requests and ensuring the AI model returned responses in the expected format was challenging.
     
  - Solution: I referred to the official Gemini AI documentation, experimented with different configurations, and added logging to ensure accurate requests and responses.  

## Future Improvements

  - Implement advanced analytics for chat history.
  - Add support for more AI models.
  - Enhance UI/UX with additional themes.
  - Introduce multi-language support.
